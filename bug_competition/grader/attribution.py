    Policy ``last_relevant_file_edit``: every passing, baseline-failing defect

    * failing -> passing: ``actor`` becomes the owner (including re-fixes after a
      regression, and merged/stale-base commits, which belong to the committer).
    * passing -> passing: transfers if any relevant file changed; otherwise unchanged.
    * now failing: no owner. A regression awards nobody; whoever flips it back
      later takes the credit.
    * passing at baseline: never owned (nothing was repaired).

    Callers score an owned defect only while it passes at the current/final head.
    False-to-true repairs also earn credit when they fix behavior indirectly,
    outside the manifest-listed files, preserving the original repair policy.
