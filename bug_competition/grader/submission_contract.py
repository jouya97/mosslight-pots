"""What the grader consumes from each replayed snapshot, declared once.

The shared checkout is the submission. The broker snapshots it after every
committed action; the final grader (and the provisional board) stages each
snapshot through ``extract`` before any probe runs. agent_data/SUBMISSION.md
states the same rules to competitors. Keep this module stdlib-only.

The limits are part of the contract. Competitors can leave anything in the
checkout (tests, caches, notes, claims, a vendored copy of some tool), so only
named source and document types cross the boundary, as regular UTF-8 files under
the caps below. The visible application is 59 admitted files and about 345 KiB,
the largest 25 KiB; the caps leave room for honest growth and no more. Snapshots
are immutable and host-owned, and nothing here imports, executes, unpacks or
follows a candidate symlink. Unadmitted files are ignored. Anything outside the
contract raises ValueError (or OSError/UnicodeError), which the grader turns
into a failed verdict for every probe: 0 points, never an exception.
