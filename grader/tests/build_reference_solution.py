"""Rebuild grader_data/reference_solution/solve.sh from the defect manifest.

Each manifest entry records the clean text (`old`) and the seeded text (`new`)
for every replacement. The reference repair replaces the seeded text with the
clean text in the agent-visible checkout. host_only/patches/*.patch run the
other way: each seeds one defect into host_only/clean_baseline (all 119 apply
there). Reversed against the visible checkout, which also carries the other 118
seeds and omits many docstrings and comments, 21 of them miss their context;
the manifest text applies to all. N01's seed also inlined the centered timestamp
offsets that its `old` text still uses, so its repair restores that setup line.
The build checks that every seeded text occurs exactly once, in order, in a
fresh visible checkout.
